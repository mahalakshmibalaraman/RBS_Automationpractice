4. Install Eclipse
User Variable Path = directory for java sdk 8 Set Maven home in environment Variables

For Windows
Create the following System variables

JAVA_HOME = PAth to java sdk
M2_HOME = Path to maven installation
MAVEN_HOME = Path to maven installation
For Windows Edit Path System variable
Add %M2_HOME%\bin
Add directory to your chromedriver.exe

  $ mkdir aut-tests
      git clone https://github.com/mahalakshmibalaraman/RBS_Automationpractice.git
      mvn clean test
 
Framework Overview:

The cucumber BDD testing framework specifies acceptance tests as written from the view of the Product Owner. Using keywords such as Given, When, Then and And, acceptance criteria tests known as feature files can then be broken down into testable steps. Jembi’s Cucumber Selenium framework is preconfigured to connect to Testrail and write test results in the form of individual test runs by specifying the test cases that are to be run. Each time the test is run it is written to Testrail at the end of the test cycle. All test results are written at once.

* Cucumber Selenium - Overall testframework leveraging the Cucumber framework with Selenium written in JAVA.
* Feature File - The feature file specifies the steps in BDD language style
* Hooks class - Hooks class is most important class as it performs the following functions
Performs Before and after functions for a scenario
* Step Definition Feature File - Java class whereby the steps from the feature file are broken down to be coded into automation tests
* Feature Model Class - Java class whereby the step definition calls on methods that require action from the automated user such as entering text, finding/asserting fields on the UI
* Feature PageObject Class - Java class whereby the necessary HTML objects are captured as WebElements to be manipulated by the associated model class
* ChromeDriver.exe - To run selenium java commands in Chrome browser
* IEDriver.exe - To run selenium java commands in IE browser
* Cucumber Reports - Cucumber has a built in report generation whereby Feature files tested are automatically written to cucumbers own reporting system

Feature File Structure: Each Feature file has it’s step defition, pageobject

Steps when we add a new Feature file :              
   1-Create Feature file and define feature scenario test & Testrail ID’s              
   2-Run project and copy method stubs from output              
   3-Create Step definition class & paste method stubs              
   4-Create Page Object Class and define objects required              
   5-Create Model Class & Define actions require with page objects              
   6-Instantiate model object in Step definition & execute tests required per step
